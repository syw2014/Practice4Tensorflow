## Introduction
The intention of this repository is to collect the best practice modules to use tensorflow and complete machine learning tasks, like how to deal with big data, create
operation graph,etc, and may also include how to imporve the efficiency of tensorflow  just like this [repo](https://github.com/vahidk/EffectiveTensorflow).

## Modules
### Read Data <a name="read_data"></a>
[Here](https://github.com/syw2014/Practice4Tensorflow/blob/master/modules/read_data/tfrecords.py) is a simple example to indicate how to create TFRecord with multi-thread, 
and prefecth mechanism parse Tensorflow.SequenceExample.The original version was came from [this](https://github.com/AIChallenger/AI_Challenger), and I have make some changes
and extention.
